The site has a wide variety of features and can be easily customized by the admin . It took me 1 weeks to complete the full site. I am still upgrading this site day by day. It has different types of features such as this site being fully responsive. I use MongoDB for the database. JWT for securing the data. This site has a dedicated Admin panel and Control panel where the admin can easily control the whole website. The admin can post new rooms, delete users, Make admin or moderator, etc. This site has many features but one of my favorite features is the User Experience. Because I took soo much time on the design and also the User Experience. I hope you like the website if you like the site feel free to send me a message on the contact form I will really appreciate that.",
